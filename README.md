Example Tariff calculator
=========================

What is it?
-----------

The Tariff calculator tool is an example of what can be built using
the new Tariff API. After building our own generic calculator we
have exposed the data behind it so it can be used by higher education
providers to build your own custom tools. This tool has been created
as a starting point, which can either be extended or used as inspiration for
your own tools.

Example of how to place the container on a page and initialise. Shows how to
override the tools domain. If not overridden this will default to https://www.ucas.com/
It is unlikely you will want to do this as currently the API is only served under this domain anyway.

Tariff calculator skeleton example.

- tariff.css

Some basic styling for the skeleton example.
