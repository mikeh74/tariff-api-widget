<h1>Example Tariff calculator</h1>

<p>This is not designed to be a fully functioning calculator, this is designed
to be a skeleton example widget to be used as a starting point for developing
your own calculators.</p>

<div id="tariff-lookup">
  <h3>It appears something went wrong, have you disabled Javascript in your browser?</h3>
  <p>This can contain some backup content in case javascript didn't run.</p>
</div>

<script type="text/javascript">
// This example works as a jQuery plugin, it simply needs a target element to
// populate and to be fired on page ready.
(function ($) {
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#tariff-lookup').tariffLookup();
  });
})(jQuery);
</script>
